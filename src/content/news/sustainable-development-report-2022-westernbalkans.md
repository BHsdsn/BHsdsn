The _Sustainable Development Report_ (SDR) reviews progress made each year on the Sustainable Development Goals since their adoption by the 193 UN Member States in 2015. Fifty years after the release of _Limits to Growth_ and the first UN Conference on the Environment, held in Stockholm in 1972, this 7th edition of the SDR is published amid multiple health, security and climate crises. The fundamental SDG principles of social inclusion, international cooperation, responsible production and consumption, and universal access to clean energy are needed more than ever to fight these major challenges of our times. Ahead of the SDG Summit in September 2023, which will convene at the level of heads of state under the auspices of the UN General Assembly, the SDR 2022 identifies major priorities to restore and accelerate SDG progress towards 2030 and beyond.
