Professor [Jeffrey Sachs](mailto:jeff.sachs@unsdsn.org), President of the SDSN, discussed global health governance and some of the key lessons that we can derive from the experience of how the world handled the COVID-19 pandemic. He addressed how different values, politics, and institutions around the world fell short in addressing the pandemic adequately. He called for an [honest accounting on the origin of the virus and on the surveillance of the work on biological pathogens](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2202769119). Moreover, Sachs pointed to the huge financing gap in the health system of poor countries that is much higher than the estimates of the World Bank. He called for the creation of a global fund that would combine the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund to fight AIDS and malaria and make it substantial enough to truly cover the financing gap in the countries that need it.

The Chair of SDSN Western Balkans, Zlatko Lagumdzija, took part in a panel on the “Changing Europe & The Security of The Western Balkans”. In his remarks, Lagumdzija stressed the importance of peace, stability and EU enlargement to the Western Balkans. Both the EU and the Western Balkans should share a common dream of a prosperous and sustainable future. SDSN Europe Network Manager, Andrija Erac, echoed this message in an [interview](https://azeritimes.com/2022/06/16/andrija-erac-global-baku-forum-helps-to-find-common-solutions/) with the Azeri Times, stating that without peace, the world will not be able to mitigate climate change and advance on sustainable development.
